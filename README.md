<h1 align="center">Harvest Tracker API</h1>

This is the backend repo of the Harvest Tracker project

The purpose of this app is to keep track of the edible plants on your property, where they are located and chart their bloom/harvest dates in order to improve plant planning. For backyard orchards, it can be difficult to handle a large harvest of a single fruit type. With this app, you will be able to see when your plants and trees will bear their fruit, so you can make selections of varieties that will extend the harvest (continuous harvest of apples over 3 months? Count me in!) vs having 4 trees that all bear fruit at the same time (:panic_processing).
